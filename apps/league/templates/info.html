                <h4><b>What is Codeleague?</b></h4><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Codeleague</b> is a platform created from the idea that everyone could be able to participate
                    in competitions in the field of computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's not all because everyone will also be able to create their own competition!
                </p><br>
                <h4><b>Can I participate in competitions?</b></h4><br>
                <p>
                    Everyone can take part in these events. You can participate alone or with a team of maximum 4
                    members.
                </p>
                <p>If you want to meet new people you have the possibility to create a free group, which means that when
                    you <br> create your group you able that other people with no group could join you. </p><br>
                <h4><b>How can I create a competition?</b></h4><br>
                <p>
                    As we want that everyone could take part in this platform, everyone is able to create their own
                    competition. <br>It's very easy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only thing you have to do is click on "Create a competition" on the home page. Afterwards,
                    you will<br> only have to fill out a very short form, and that's all!
                </p><br>
                <h4><b>How the winners will be announced?</b></h4><br>
                <p>
                    Even every competition will have different challenges. Despite this, the way to evaluate every group
                    and <br>proclaim a winner will be the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all competitions, every challenge will have a score. When you deliver any challenge, depending
                    on how <br>you have solved it, your group will add more or less points to the scoreboard.
                </p>
                <p>During the competition a ranking will be continuously updated, and when the competition finishes,
                    the <br>ranking will be updated with the final scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will contact the winners personally to make sure they receive their prize!
